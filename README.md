# Store my VIM related files

This is *based* on this VIMRC tutorial:
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/vimrc-configuration-guide-customize-your-vim-editor/

I got tired of losing my .vimrc and related config files all the time.
When I'm improving my learning curve about VIM, having all sort of fancy
plugins and configurations working smoothly together, I suddenly lose
all of the them.

So I'm gonna store them in this repo now, and as the config improves, this
repo will improve too.

So if you are looking around and want to experiment the amazing lightweight vim text editor go ahead
and pull out those files. Have fun :)
